# doghouse-heater
Arduino UNO based heater with NPN bipolar transistor and LM35 sensors.
Hi thanks for using my code.
You will need 12VDC.
LM35 2pcs
NPN transistor like BD249 1pc
Resistors in base cicuit . 6pcs

NPN transisor must be on heatsink
On the heatsink you put one temp sensor.
Other temp sensor senses the sir temperature.

If the temperature is low other pin will give power for the base of the transisor.
Quite easy.
